# nim-mycin (wip)

Implementation of toy Mycin expert system in [Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim).

For learning Nim, and to get reacquainted with rule based systems in the LLM era. Mainly I want to figure out if there is some marriage of the two that would make clinical expert systems viable.
